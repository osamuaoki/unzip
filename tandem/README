A few notes about the files on this subvol

COMMACS   -  required by MAKE, *** held on ZIP subvol ***
DOIT      -  macro to extract required Tandem files from archive and rename
MACROS    -  required by MAKE, *** held on ZIP subvol ***
MAKE      -  recompile UNZIP code, attempts to only recompile changed code
README    -  this file
UNZIPLIB  -  library of ZIP compiled routines, used by ZIP/ZIPNOTE etc
UNZIPL    -  ZIP object (bound using LARGE memory model)

*C        -  Source file
*H        -  Header files
*O        -  Individual object files (when compiled by MAKE)

Install Notes:
==============
Stage 1 - get UNZIP object onto Tandem
- download Tandem Unzip executables archive from Web
- using PC unzip program (e.g. pkunzip/WinZip) extract UNZIP
- copy UNZIP from PC to Tandem in Binary mode s(FTP/IXF)
- alter file code to 100
- optionally place in $SYSTEM.SYSTEM to allow easy access from command line

Stage 2 - (optional) retrieve source code (requires UNZIP on Tandem)
- download UNZIP source archive from web - contains all supported platforms
- copy archive onto Tandem as Binary
- extract Tandem DOIT macro ( UNZIP -j <archive> tandem/DOIT )
- update DOIT macro to point at archive file
- restore relevant files by running DOIT
- replace all references to $DATA9.DAVESUNZ with whatever subvol you use
- replace all references to $DATA9.DAVESZIP with whatever subvol you use
  this is required by the MAKE macro file to pick up MACROS and COMMACS
- replace references to SUPER.DAVES with whatever user id you use
- to compile run MAKE

Additional Notes - LICENSE the object:
If you wish to be able to update the last modified time of files you unzip
you need to use the #define LICENSED and then FUP LICENSE the file
as SUPER.SUPER.  This is a Tandem restriction since we have to call a PRIV
procedure to do this.  For UNZIP the define is setup (default) in tandem.h
