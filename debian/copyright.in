This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of "unzip", Info-Zip's
fast, portable, zipfile decompression utility.

This package is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>
and built from sources obtained from:

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/src/unzip540.tar.gz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted solely of adding
various debian/* files to the distribution.
