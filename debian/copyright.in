This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of "unzip", Info-Zip's
fast, portable, zipfile decompression utility.

This package is currently maintained by Santiago Vila <sanvila@ctv.es>
and built from sources obtained from:

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/info-zip/src/unzip532.tar.gz

The changes were fairly minimal, and consisted solely of adding
various debian/* files to the distribution.

In the file `email-from-greg' there is an email from Greg Roelofs,
providing explicit permission to place zip and unzip into the Debian
distribution proper, but according to our Social Contract and the latest
debian-policy, we may not do it.
