Here's the readme and copyright file for Debian GNU/Linux's
package of unzip, Info-Zip's fast, portable, zipfile 
decompression utility.

I obtained the original sources from ftp://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/

The only mods I made were to add support for Debian's packaging scheme.
I have also received an email from George Roelofs, providing explicit
permission to place zip and unzip into the Debian distribution proper.

Here's the copyright:


__________________________________________________________________________

  This is the Info-ZIP file COPYING (for UnZip), last updated 10 Aug 94.
__________________________________________________________________________

   There are currently three explicit copyrights on portions of UnZip
   code (at least, of which Info-ZIP is aware):  the original Sam Smith
   copyright on unzip 2.0, upon which Info-ZIP's UnZip 3.0 was based;
   Igor Mandrichenko's copyright on his routines in vms.c; and Greg
   Roelofs' copyright on the new version of unshrink.c.  In addition,
   Mark Adler has placed inflate.h, inflate.c, explode.c and funzip.c
   into the public domain; i.e., these files may be used without any
   restrictions beyond those of simple courtesy (credit where it's due).
   All of these are discussed immediately below; the Frequently Asked
   Questions regarding (re)distribution of Zip and UnZip are near the
   end of this file.
__________________________________________________________________________

   The original unzip source code has been extensively modified and
   mostly rewritten (changes include random zipfile access rather than
   sequential; replacement of unimplode() with explode(); replacement
   of output routines; addition of inflate(), wildcards, filename-
   mapping, text translation, ...; etc.).  As far as we can tell, the
   only remaining code which is substantially similar to Mr. Smith's
   is that in the files unreduce.c and the old version of unshrink.c
   (although even those have been modified), to which the following
   copyright therefore applies:

     * Copyright 1989 Samuel H. Smith;  All rights reserved
     *
     * Do not distribute modified versions without my permission.
     * Do not remove or alter this notice or any other copyright notice.
     * If you use this in your own program you must distribute source code.
     * Do not use any of this in a commercial product.

   Regarding the first stipulation, Mr. Smith was finally tracked down
   in southern California [Samuel H. Smith, The Tool Shop, P.O. Box 8808,
   Panorama City, CA  91412-4808, (818) 891-4228 (voice), (818) 891-6780
   (BBS, 2400 baud, free access)]  [ADDITIONAL NOTE, July 1994:  he's
   moved again, as of mid-May 1994; these numbers are no longer correct]:

   "He says that he thought that whoever contacted him understood that
    he has no objection to the Info-ZIP group's inclusion of his code.
    His primary concern is that it remain freely distributable, he said."

   Info-ZIP is indebted and grateful to Mr. Smith; we hope he finds our
   contributions as useful as we have his.

   Note that the third and fourth stipulations still apply to any com-
   pany which wishes to incorporate the unreduce and/or "old" unshrink
   code into its products; if you wish to do so, you must contact Mr.
   Smith regarding licensing.


   The following copyright applies to most of the VMS code in vms.c,
   distributed with UnZip versions 4.2 and later:

     * Copyright (C) 1992 Igor Mandrichenko.
     * Permission is granted to any individual or institution to use,
     * copy, or redistribute this software so long as all of the orig-
     * inal files are included unmodified, that it is not sold for
     * profit, and that this copyright notice is retained.


   The following copyright applies to the new version of "unshrink" in
   unshrink.c, distributed with UnZip versions 5.11 and later:

     * Copyright (C) 1994 Greg Roelofs.
     * Permission is granted to any individual/institution/corporate
     * entity to use, copy, redistribute or modify this software for
     * any purpose whatsoever, subject to the conditions noted in the
     * Frequently Asked Questions section below, plus one additional
     * condition:  namely, that my name remain attached to the source
     * code.  (Other names may, of course, be added as modifications
     * are made.)  Corporate legal staff (like at IBM :-) ) who have
     * problems understanding this can contact me through zip-bugs...


   The remaining code was written by many people associated with the
   Info-ZIP group, with large contributions from (but not limited to):
   Mark Adler (inflate, explode, funzip), Kai Uwe Rommel (OS/2), John
   Bush and Paul Kienitz (Amiga), Antoine Verheijen (Macintosh), Hunter
   Goatley (more VMS) and Greg Roelofs (lots of stuff).  See the file
   CONTRIBS in the source distribution for a much more complete list of
   contributors.  As noted above, Mark Adler's inflate.[ch], explode.c
   and funzip.c are in the public domain.  As for the remaining code,
   while it may not be explicitly copyrighted, we do request that no
   one else try to copyright it, either.  In other words, use it with
   our blessings, but it's still our code.  (You can consider that an
   implicit copyright if it makes you feel better. :-) )  Thank you!

   Frequently Asked Questions about distributing Zip and UnZip:


   Q. Can I distribute Zip and UnZip sources and/or executables?

   A. You may redistribute the latest official distributions without
      any modification, and without even asking us for permission.
      [Note that an "executable distribution" includes documentation,
      even if it's in a separate zipfile; plain executables do NOT
      count.]  You can charge for the cost of the media (CDROM, disk-
      ettes, etc.) and a small copying fee.  Distributed archives
      should follow the naming conventions used in the Where file.
      If you want to distribute modified versions please contact us
      at zip-bugs@wkuvx1.wku.edu first.  You must not distribute beta
      versions without explicit permission to do so.


   Q. Can I use the executables of Zip and UnZip to distribute my
      software?

   A. Yes, so long as it is clear that Zip and UnZip are not being
      sold, that the source code is freely available, and that there
      are no extra or hidden charges resulting from its use by or in-
      clusion with the commercial product.  Here is an example of a
      suitable notice:

         NOTE:  <Product> is packaged on this CD using Info-ZIP's
         compression utility.  The installation program uses UnZip
         to read zip files from the CD.  Info-ZIP's software (Zip,
         UnZip and related utilities) is free and can be obtained
         as source code or executables from various bulletin board
         services and anonymous-ftp sites, including CompuServe's
         IBMPRO forum and ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/*.


   Q. Can I use the source code of Zip and UnZip in my commercial
      application?

   A. Yes, so long as you include in your product an acknowledgment
      and an offer of the original compression sources for free or for
      a small copying fee, and make clear that there are no extra or
      hidden charges resulting from the use of the compression code by
      your product (see below for an example).  The acknowledgment should
      appear in at least one piece of human-readable documentation (e.g.,
      a README file or man page), although additionally putting it in
      the executable(s) is OK, too.  In other words, you are allowed to
      sell only your own work, not ours--and we'd like a little credit.
      [Note the additional restrictions above on the code in unreduce.c,
      unshrink.c and vms.c.]  Contact us at zip-bugs@wkuvx1.wku.edu if
      you have special requirements.  We also like to know when our code
      is being used, but we don't require that.

         <Product> incorporates compression code by the Info-ZIP group.
         There are no extra charges or costs due to the use of this code,
         and the original compression sources are freely available from
         CompuServe in the IBMPRO forum and by anonymous ftp from the
         Internet site ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip.  We will also, upon
         request, mail you the full sources on a 3.5" MSDOS-format disk-
         ette for the cost of mailing.  Send $2.00 to <address> and ..."

Ah, very slick.  I really should take the time to look at Debian in 
detail one of these days, but I haven't even had time to upgrade all
of my exes at home to ELF yet. :-(

Yes, especially given their prominence in Slackware (no slight intended)--
they're on the very first disk set, i.e., they're always installed.

Anyway, the old message is appended below; to sum up:  you guys have our
explicit permission to distribute Zip, UnZip and related utilities with
the normal Debian stuff, on CD-ROM or off, with or without your additional
package files (almost said "RPM" there...), and with or without Zip encryp-
tion (at your option).  If you make what a normal programmer would consider
source-code changes, please let us know about it.

Regards,
