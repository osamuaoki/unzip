Description: De-archiver for .zip files
 InfoZIP's unzip program, packaged for Debian GNU/Linux. With the exception
 of multi-volume archives (ie, .ZIP files that are split across several
 disks using PKZIP's /& option), this can handle any file produced either
 by PKZIP, or the corresponding InfoZIP zip program.
 .
 Note that this is unzip 5.2: it is called 5.20 (which InfoZIP see as
 equivalent) for Debian.
