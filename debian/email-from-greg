Ah, very slick.  I really should take the time to look at Debian in 
detail one of these days, but I haven't even had time to upgrade all
of my exes at home to ELF yet. :-(

Yes, especially given their prominence in Slackware (no slight intended)--
they're on the very first disk set, i.e., they're always installed.

Anyway, the old message is appended below; to sum up:  you guys have our
explicit permission to distribute Zip, UnZip and related utilities with
the normal Debian stuff, on CD-ROM or off, with or without your additional
package files (almost said "RPM" there...), and with or without Zip encryp-
tion (at your option).  If you make what a normal programmer would consider
source-code changes, please let us know about it.

Regards,
