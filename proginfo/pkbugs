Known, current PKZIP bugs/limitations:
-------------------------------------

 - PKUNZIP 2.04g considers volume labels valid only if originated on a FAT
   file system, but other OSes and file systems (e.g., Amiga and OS/2 HPFS) 
   support volume labels, too

 - PKUNZIP 2.04g can restore volume labels created by Zip 2.x but not by
   PKZIP 2.04g (OS/2 DOS box only??)

 - PKUNZIP 2.04g gives an error message for stored directory entries created
   under other OSes (although it creates the directory anyway), and PKZIP -vt
   does not report the directory attribute bit as being set, even if it is

 - PKZIP 2.04g mangles unknown extra fields (especially OS/2 extended attri-
   butes) when adding new files to an existing zipfile [example:  Walnut Creek
   Hobbes March 1995 CD-ROM, FILE_ID.DIZ additions]

 - PKUNZIP 2.04g is unable to detect or deal with prepended junk in a zipfile,
   reporting CRC errors in valid compressed data.

 - [Windows version 2.01] Win95 long filenames (VFAT) are stored OK, but the
   file system is listed as ordinary DOS FAT

Possibly current PKZIP bugs:
---------------------------

 - PKZIP (2.04g?) can silently ignore read errors on network drives, storing
   the correct CRC and compressed length but an incorrect and inconsistent
   uncompressed length

 - PKZIP (2.04g?), when deleting files from within a zipfile on a Novell
   drive, sometimes only zeros out the data while failing to shrink the
   zipfile.

Other limitations:
-----------------

 - PKZIP 1.x and 2.x encryption has been cracked (known-plaintext approach)

[many other bugs in versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.93a, 2.04c and 2.04e]
