Use the "RunMe1st" file (it is an Obey file) to convert all the files from
"filename/[chs]" to "[chs].filename" (so that Unzip could be easily compiled
under RISC OS). It will also set the correct makefile.

To compile just set the CSD to the main unzip directory and run 'amu'.

Currently only the Acorn C V5 compiler has been tested but probably also
Acorn C V4 and the Acorn Assembler V2 will be able to compile unzip.
